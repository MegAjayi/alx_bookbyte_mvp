        <p>Hey there! I'm <span class="highlight">Ajayi Margret</span>, a passionate frontend developer transitioning from a 6-year career in customer service. My journey into tech started with curiosity and a desire to build meaningful digital experiences.</p>
        <p>BookByte is my brainchildâ€”an online bookstore designed to help users easily search for books, download free ones, and be redirected to purchase paid ones. I built this platform with love, combining my growing skills in frontend and backend development.</p>
        <p>While this project is powered by <span class="highlight">Passion</span> for now, I'm committed to leveling up my skills and mastering best practices in web development.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
